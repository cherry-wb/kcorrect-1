Installation
------------

This version of KCorrect requires the following software to be already
installed on your machine:

  -- Python 2.3.5 or better (http://www.python.org/)
  -- NumPy 1.0rc1 or better (http://www.scipy.org/Download/)
  -- SWIG 1.3.24 or better (http://www.swig.org/)

(Rather I should mention these are the versions of software used to
test the codes.)

After making sure the above software are installed properly, simply
do:

  # python setup.py install

as root to install KCorrect in Python's site-packages directory.  If
you wish to install KCorrect in some other local directory (i.e., you
cannot become root), do

  $ python setup.py install --prefix='~'

to install KCorrect in ~/lib/python2.3/site-packages, for example.
